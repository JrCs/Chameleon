Chameleon Boot Loader Project
=============================

Chameleon is a boot loader to boot OS X on compatible, standard PC-hardware.
It's based on Apple's boot-132 project and various components and additions
from the hackintosh community.
  
The Chameleon Boot Loader is released under the terms and conditions of Apple
Public Source License (see APPLE_LICENSE).

This project is divided into so far:
	- Booter:	the bootloader itself
	- PrefPane:	a upcoming Mac OS X Preferences Pane
